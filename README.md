# summerProject2022
The entire project consists of data processing for two regions, Halifax and Toronto.
<br>
<br>

## Halifax
### Halifax_data folder
The data folder contains the original data file, and the processed data file.
<br>
<br>
### Halifax_image folder
The image folder includes drawn maps and graph.
<br>
<br>
### Halifax package
The python files in this package implement different functions, such as processing data and drawing graphs for H.<br>
##### extract_halifax.py
Use the dataset Census tracts Cartographic Boundary File which is saved in 'Halifax_data/map_boundary' folder.<br>
Data sourceï¼šhttps://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2016-eng.cfm <br>
From this dataset to obtain the data of boundary for the entire Canadian region, from which Halifax data are extracted and save in 'Halifax_data/whole_halifax' folder.<br>
Draw the map for whole Halifax which is 'Halifax_image/whole_halifax.png'.<br>
<br>
##### count_accident.py
Use the dataset Traffic collision which is saved in 'Halifax_data' folder.<br>
Data source: https://catalogue-hrm.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e0293fd4721e41d7be4d7386c3c59c16_0/explore?location=44.669039%2C-63.625224%2C12.98 <br>
From this dataset, positions of accidents happened in Halifax are obtained. Count the number of accidents happend in each district in Halifax and save date in 'Halifax_data/accident_number' folder.<br>
<br>
##### center.py
Based on the number counted, the area with the highest number of accidents is selected as the central point. Areas near the central point are selected and is saved in 'Halifax_data/Halifax_center' folder. Only this part of area will be addressed next.<br>
Draw two maps. One is the map of center of Halifax with centroid on each district which is 'Halifax_image/map_centroid.png'. Another is the map of it with number of accidents annotated on each district which is 'Halifax_image/map_number.png'.<br>
<br>
##### rate.py
The average number of accidents per month/day/hour for each district are all calculated and stored.<br>
The saved file covers the original file in 'Halifax_data/Halifax_center' folder.<br>
<br>
##### graph.py
Each district is treated as a node and neighbouring regions are connected by edges. Draw the map that each node has rate on it.<br>
The graph with month rate on it is 'Halifax_image/graph_month.png'. The corresponding map is 'Halifax_image/map_month.png'. The json data of this graph save in 'Halifax_data/graph_month.json'.<br>
The graph with day rate on it is 'Halifax_image/graph_day.png'. The corresponding map is 'Halifax_image/map_day.png'. The json data of this graph save in 'Halifax_data/graph_day.json'.<br>
The graph with hour rate on it is 'Halifax_image/graph_hour.png'. The corresponding map is 'Halifax_image/map_hour.png'. The json data of this graph save in Halifax_'data/graph_hour.json'.

## Toronto
The process of handling the data is the same as for xx, except for a few changes.<br>
Folders and python code are corresponding.<br>
The dataset of traffic collision for Toronto is from: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/0ed673d90813403badd49315162c78c9_0/explore?location=43.702943%2C-79.328777%2C11.90
